                                        - you play as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, who have been

                                        of a vast space station. Using advanced gear and weaponry, you embark on a
                                        desperate mission together to find your ship
                                        and blast your way home.

                                        ranged weaponry to help you combat cyborg guards, alien organisms, and defeat
                                        the final boss to get your ship back.<br><br>
